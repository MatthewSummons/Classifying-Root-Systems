# Classifying Root Systems

This repository formalises the classification of root systems in the context of Lie algebras. The classification is based on the Dynkin diagrams of the root systems. The Dynkin diagrams are classified into four infinite families and five exceptional cases. The classification is based on the work of Wilhelm Killing and Ã‰lie Cartan.
